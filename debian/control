Description: Modular toolkit for Data Processing
 Python data processing framework for building complex data processing software
 by combining widely used machine learning algorithms into pipelines and
 networks. Implemented algorithms include: Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
 Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), Independent
 Slow Feature Analysis (ISFA), Growing Neural Gas (GNG), Factor Analysis,
 Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA), and Gaussian Classifiers.
 .
 This package contains MDP for Python 2.
