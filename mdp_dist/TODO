TODO:

MDP 2.3 15.5.2008:

- do new screenshots
- short and long description in a single file, automatically updated everywhere
  (tutorial, sf.net, setup.py, webpage, MDP announcement, ...)
- offer 'gemm' interface and use it in the nodes
- fix 'fftpack' calls in benchmarks and tests
- check weird Segmentation Fault in testRoundOffWarningCovMatrix with type='g'
  (it's probably a numpy.dot bug)
- better tests for 'QuadraticForms'
- kalman filters
- memory profiler
- GUI
