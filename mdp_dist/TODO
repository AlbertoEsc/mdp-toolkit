blockers for MDP 3.0
====================
- switch from SVN to Hg
- add classifier stuff
- finisch SVN integration (already done?)
- decide if we want to move binet into MDP (maybe declare binet as "beta"
    in MDP 3.0), discuss possible changes that would improve binet
- binet: write more unittests and write tutorial section


optional for MDP 3.0
====================
- switch to a more permissive license (like BSD)
- add example section on the homepage
- binet: add deep belief network example
- parallel: use shared memory for data in the parallel ProcessScheduler
    and use caching for the results as well
- refactor unitests
- check if sphinx could be used as an alternative for automatic API docs
- add cross-correlation tools, maybe support the use of a parallel scheduler


beyond the next release
=======================
- migration to Python 3 when the dependencies are ready
- parallel: provide adapters for more sophisticated schedulers




old list
========

MDP 2.5 30.06.2009:

- solve the svn revision tracking problem (see log comment on rev 468)

MDP 2.4 17.10.2008:

- LinearRegressionNode: add optional 2nd phase that computes residuals
  and significance of the slope
- check eta value calculations: shouldn't t-> T/t=tlen?
- provide a Node pickler, for arrays use the binary numpy format (npy,
  numpy.save, numpy.load) and not pickle: pickling arrays is unsupported
- add benchmarks for parallel module
- provide different versions of the MDP logo which includes the
  website address, possibly one higher quality print version,
  available in "how to cite" section
- short and long description in a single file, automatically 
  updated everywhere (tutorial, sf.net, setup.py, webpage, 
  MDP announcement, ...) 
- wrappers for external libraries? (which ones?)
- forward compatible with python 3?
- POSTPONED TO PY2.6 should is_trainable, is_invertible be class 
  attributes or maybe a class decorator?
- think about a better structure for the unittests in the future,
  the transition could happen package by package 
  (starting with parallel)
- Implement Node.copy() via the copy module? Provide __deepcopy__ method?
- Use the new property decorators when migrating to Python 2.6 (see
  http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#property).

MDP 2.3 15.5.2008:

- check weird Segmentation Fault in testRoundOffWarningCovMatrix with type='g'
  (it's probably a numpy.dot bug)
- better tests for 'QuadraticForms'
- kalman filters
- memory profiler
- GUI
