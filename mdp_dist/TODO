TODO:

MDP 2.4 17.10.2008:

- check eta value calculations: shouldn't t-> T/t=tlen?
- add version and symeig as an output for tests, provide svn revision
  in the version string.
- provide a Node pickler, for arrays use the binary numpy format (npy,
  numpy.save, numpy.load) and not pickle: pickling arrays is unsupported
- add benchmarks for parallel module
- provide different versions of the MDP logo which includes the
  website address, possibly one higher quality print version,
  available in "how to cite" section
- short and long description in a single file, automatically 
  updated everywhere (tutorial, sf.net, setup.py, webpage, 
  MDP announcement, ...) 
- wrappers for external libraries? (which ones?)
- forward compatible with python 3?
- POSTPONED TO PY2.6 should is_trainable, is_invertible be class 
  attributes or maybe a class decorator?
- include the XSFA Node from Henning (maybe wait for later release)
- think about a better structure for the unittests in the future,
  the transition could happen package by package 
  (starting with parallel)
- Mark parallelizable nodes with a class decorator when they are defined.
  The class decorator would be given the parallel class. We could then store all
  the __init__ parameters, so that new instances can be created more easily in
  fork.
  Or decorate only the parallel node version with a reference to the original
  node.
  If we add additional parallelisation techniques (e.g. OpenCL) one could
  introduce more class decorators. The same would work for stuff like a
  gradient decent interface.
- Implement Node.copy() via the copy module? Provide __deepcopy__ method?

MDP 2.3 15.5.2008:

- check weird Segmentation Fault in testRoundOffWarningCovMatrix with type='g'
  (it's probably a numpy.dot bug)
- better tests for 'QuadraticForms'
- kalman filters
- memory profiler
- GUI
