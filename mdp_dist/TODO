TODO:

MDP 2.4 x.x.x:

- code restyling by PEP8
- wrappers for external libraries? (which ones?)
- (try python 2.6 -3 and get rid of all warnings, to have code 
  forward compatible with python 3)
- metaclass for Node to avoid overwriting methods for documentation
  purposes
- full integration of the LLE nodes (how do we test them?)
- updating the tutorial using the text we wrote for the paper,
  adding an example similar to the LLE demo
- what about helper functions? should we add an intrface to new nodes?
- choose a new color for the website :-))
- provide different versions of the MDP logo which includes the website address,
  possibly one higher quality print version, available in "how to cite" section
- include the XSFA Node from Henning (maybe wait for later release)
- think about a better structure for the unittests in the future,
  the transition could happen package by package (starting with parallel)
- try to bring the parallel package into shape for a release
- why are in RBMWithLabelsNode the train and execute method overwritten 
  (instead of _train and _execute)?
- make the 'mdp' module reloadable
- failure in introspection.py for python2.6 (maximum recursion depth exceeded)

MDP 2.3 15.5.2008:

- do new screenshots
- short and long description in a single file, automatically updated everywhere
  (tutorial, sf.net, setup.py, webpage, MDP announcement, ...)
- offer 'gemm' interface and use it in the nodes
- fix 'fftpack' calls in benchmarks and tests
- check weird Segmentation Fault in testRoundOffWarningCovMatrix with type='g'
  (it's probably a numpy.dot bug)
- better tests for 'QuadraticForms'
- kalman filters
- memory profiler
- GUI
