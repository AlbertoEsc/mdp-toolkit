TODO:

MDP 2.1 21.3.2006:

- do screenshots on the web site still make any sense?
- short and long description in a single file, automatically updated everywhere
  (tutorial, sf.net, setup.py, webpage, MDP announcement, ...)
- offer 'gemm' interface and use it in the nodes
- verify 'utils.symrand' theoretical foundations
- 'HitParadeNode' for any input dtype (almost done: added integer types)
- fix 'fftpack' calls in benchmarks and tests
- check weird Segmentation Fault in testRoundOffWarningCovMatrix with type='g'
  (it's probably a numpy.dot bug)

- better tests for 'QuadraticForms'
- update FastICA to match new Matlab version (done)
- kalman filters
- memory profiler
- flow to handle acyclic graphs of nodes
- GUI
