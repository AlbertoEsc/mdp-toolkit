TODO:

MDP 2.4 17.10.2008:

- add benchmarks for parallel module
- provide different versions of the MDP logo which includes the
  website address, possibly one higher quality print version,
  available in "how to cite" section
- short and long description in a single file, automatically 
  updated everywhere (tutorial, sf.net, setup.py, webpage, 
  MDP announcement, ...) 
- wrappers for external libraries? (which ones?)
- forward compatible with python 3?
- POSTPONED TO PY2.6 should is_trainable, is_invertible be class 
  attributes or maybe a class decorator?
- include the XSFA Node from Henning (maybe wait for later release)
- think about a better structure for the unittests in the future,
  the transition could happen package by package 
  (starting with parallel)

MDP 2.3 15.5.2008:

- check weird Segmentation Fault in testRoundOffWarningCovMatrix with type='g'
  (it's probably a numpy.dot bug)
- better tests for 'QuadraticForms'
- kalman filters
- memory profiler
- GUI
